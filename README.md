# gammascoututil
This is an ancient project of mine, gammascoututil. It's a tool to read out
Gamma Scout Geiger counters via USB and record their radation measurements.

It's kind of abandoned by me. I wanted however to preserve the history and also
push some code that has made it through testing, but was never ever released.
The last official release is v0.04, but the release candidate that came after
(0.05alpha9) is probably also fine. There has been some more development
afterwards of which I'm entirely unsure if the code even works. So if you're
looking for something reliable, choose one of the older tags.

Most notably, 0.05 adds support for the Gamma Scout Online and some conversion
curves from counts/sec to ÂµSv/hr.
